These data are from the end of the winter semester of the 2020-2021 academic
year. In the period of data collection, all university classes were entirely
online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While expected learning outcomes were not
changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could
have implications for data.

**Average SET scores** were combined with many other variables, including:

1.  **characteristics of the teacher** (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in
the past 6 semesters).
2.  **characteristics of the course** (time of day, day of the week, course
type, course breadth, class duration, class size).
3.  **percentage of students providing SET feedback.**
4.  **course grades** (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the
current course and previous 6 semesters).

This rich dataset allows us to **investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching** that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new
hypotheses.

Before tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable
included in the `teacher_evals_codebook.pdf`.

**1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis.**

```{r}
#| label: setup
# code chunk for loading packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

**2. Load in the `teacher_evals` data.** 

```{r}
#| label: load-data
# code chunk for importing the data
eval<-read_csv("teacher_evals.csv")
```

### Data Inspection + Summary

**3. Provide a brief overview (~4 sentences) of the dataset.**

```{r}
#| label: explore-data
# you may want to use code to answer this question
summary(eval)

```

**4. What is the unit of observation (i.e. a single row in the dataset) identified by?**

```{r}
#| label: row-identification
# you may want to use code to answer this question
```
Each row is a class
**5. Use _one_ `dplyr` pipeline to clean the data by:**

- **renaming the `gender` variable `sex`**
- **removing all courses with fewer than 10 respondents**
- **changing data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID really a numeric data type?)**
- **only keeping the columns we will use -- `course_id`, `teacher_id`, `question_no`, `no_participants`, `resp_share`, `SET_score_avg`, `percent_failed_cur`, `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `sex`**

**Assign your cleaned data to a new variable named `teacher_evals_clean` â€“- use these data going forward. Save the data as `teacher_evals_clean.csv` in the `data-clean` folder.**

```{r}
#| label: data-cleaning
# code chunk for Q4

```

**6. How many unique instructors and unique courses are present in the cleaned dataset?**

```{r}
#| label: unique-courses
# code chunk for Q5

```

**7. One teacher-course combination has some missing values, coded as `NA`. Which instructor has these missing values? Which course? What variable are the missing values in?**

```{r}
#| label: uncovering-missing-values
# code chunk for Q6

```

**8. What are the demographics of the instructors in this study? Investigate the variables `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `sex` and summarize your findings in ~3 complete sentences.**

```{r}
#| label: exploring-demographics-of-instructors
# code chunk for Q7

```

**9. Each course seems to have used a different subset of the nine evaluation questions. How many teacher-course combinations asked all nine questions?**

```{r}
#| label: teacher-course-asked-every-question
# code chunk for Q8

```

## Rate my Professor

**10. Which instructors had the highest and lowest average rating for Question 1 (I learnt a lot during the course.) across all their courses?**

```{r}
#| label: question-1-high-low
# code chunk for Q9

```

**11. Which instructors with one year of experience had the highest and lowest average percentage of students failing in the current semester across all their courses?**

```{r}
#| label: one-year-experience-failing-students
# code chunk for Q10

```

**12. Which female instructors with either a doctorate or professional degree had the highest and lowest average percent of students responding to the evaluation across all their courses?**

```{r}
#| label: female-instructor-student-response
# code chunk for Q11

```
